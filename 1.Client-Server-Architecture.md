### Network Protocols: ( set of rules how a computer process the data)

1. IP
2. TCP
3.  HTTP

- Computer sends the data in the form IP data packets which is stored  in bytes.  It has two main sectionss
    - IP Header and IP version
    - IP Header consits of source and destination IP adresses, packet size and
    - IP Version consists of IPv4 or IPv6.

- Rest of the data packet other than IP header and version is Data which is limited to 0.065Mb per packet hence we need to send multiple packets.
- You must gurantee the order in which the IP Packets are sent to ensure the correct data is sent otherwise reciever will get incorrect information this is where TCP comes in to the picture.


##### TCP:

- TCP ensures the IP Packets are sents in an order with reliability. to ensure this reliability each IP Packet will have a TCP header in its Data section
- SO Basically when a Browser is trying to connect to a server it first needs to establish a TCP Connection which is known as Handshake.

- If TCP connection is closed by either client or server. ex: closing a browser. If its failed to estabish a connection within the fixed amount of time Connection Timeout will happen.
- TCP however lacks a easy to use framework where we are sending aribitary data this is where HTTP comes in.

##### HTTP:

- It introduces a higher level of abstraction on TCP
- Dev dont write code to interact with TCP rather HTTP ex: you dont write assembly language rather a C language
- There are types of HTTP requests

- Often the terms REST and HTTP are used interchangebly while REST is architectural Style HTTP is an network protocol.  Its not REST but exhibits many features of REST API systems.
